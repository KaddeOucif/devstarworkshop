## Clone code using Git ##

We now need to clone one of the Git repositories displayed on the previous page to our local machine.
If you are already experienced with Git and you already have the neccessary tools, you might already know how to get a copy of the repository for your weapon to you local machine. In that case, just ignore the instructions below and continue on to the [first mission](missions/deploy.md).


### I want to use the Git command line interface ###

If you don't want an IDE such as Eclipse to perform Git actions for you but instead want to use the Git command line interface, check out the instructions [here!](deployment/commandlinegit.md)

### I want to use Eclipse's built in Git ###

If you prefer using Eclipse to perform Git actions, please find the instructions [here!](deployment/eclipsegit.md)

### I want to use another IDE with built in Git ###

We are not giving instructions on how to perform Git actions on every IDE. However, you should be able to use any IDE with Git support of your liking to clone the Git repositories.


### Next: First Mission ###

If you've cloned your code, you are ready to face your first mission! [click here](missions/deploy.md) to start your first mission!
