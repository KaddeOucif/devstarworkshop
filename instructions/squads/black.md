## Welcome to the Black Squad. Pick your weapon! ##

+ Weapon selection strategy is completely up to your preference. Every squad members can have the same weapon, different weapons or chose to have no weapon at all.
+ Each git repository includes the basic code that is needed in order to run and deploy your microservice to the battle action!
+ Clone your selected weapon code to your local machine as per below. If you are using NetBeans or Eclipse with OEPE, you can use the integrated Oracle Cloud plugin to let your IDE manage the Git actions for you. TODO: Insert instructions for this.
