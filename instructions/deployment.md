## Know your deployment options! ##

+ Deployment strategy is completely up to your preference. Every squad members can have the same or different type of deployment strategy.
+ In short, the [Continous Integration and Deployment](deployment/deployment.md) strategy means that whenever you want to update your application you simply perform a ```git push USERNAME@REPOSITORY``` command with the same Git repository as for your ```git clone``` command. The [manual](deployment/manually.md) approach means that you zip your application locally and then deploy that zip file in the Application Container Cloud user interface.
