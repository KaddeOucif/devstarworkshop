# Deploy Manually #

If you are here is because you are a brave Xwing fighter and you don't need help of your R2D2 (Developer Cloud Service) with the package and deployment.
So remember, depending on the language you choose, there are a couple of different requirements in order to be able to compile and package your applications locally. In the first part of this page we give you some hints and basic recommendations regarding compilation, testing locally and packaging. In the bottom of the page you'll find a tutorial with basic instructions on how to then deploy your application to Oracle Application Container Cloud.

## Build, package and test ##

  **Java: Maven and JDK installed**
  
  Inside the folder where your code is cloned:
  
  To build and compile:
        
         mvn clean package
  
  Then to run or test locally:
  
         java -jar target/XwingApp-1.0.jar
         
  If successfull, your application should be running at *http://localhost:8080*
    
 **To Zip the final deployable artefact, you should Zip the manifest.json file together with the target/XwingApp-1.0.jar file. Alternatively, you should find a zip file in the target folder that you can deploy directly**
   
   
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  **Node.js: NPM installed**
    
  To run or test locally:
    
         node ./bin/www
         
  If successfull, your application should be running in *http://localhost:3000*
    
  **To Zip the final deployable artefact, you should Zip everything in the xwingnodeclient folder.**
  
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  **PHP: Apache web server and PHP installed**
  
  This tutorial does not cover the details of running a PHP application locally. If you have selected this weapon, we trust you know how to run a PHP file on a local server such as Apache. However, once you are happy, zip your PHP files together with the manifest.json into a zip file.
  
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: At the end of the compilation process, regardless of language,  you should have a **zip file** containing the application (or static content) and the respective **manifest.json** file to proceed to deployment as explained below.
