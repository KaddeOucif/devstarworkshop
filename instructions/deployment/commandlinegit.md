## Clone using Git command line interface ##

First, make sure you have the Git URL for the weapon of your selection (displayed after [squad selection](../squadSelection.md)).

1. Create a local folder in your machine. 

2. From inside that folder run ``` git clone ```, e.g: ``` git clone https://URLofRepository/nameOfRepository.git ```

3. You should need to enter the credentials for the repository. These credentials should be available to you in the Excel sheet.

You now have your code cloned locally!
