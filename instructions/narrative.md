Fortunately, one of our companions is a spy and have managed to sneak into the Death Star. During our mission, he will report valueable information that might help us bring down the Death Star!

## How to play ##

#### Objective ####

By developing X-Wing fighters (microservices) in either Java, Node.js or PHP, you will complete missions in order to defeat the Death Star. The missions will be explained in the instructions, but you can't complete some of the missions without valuable information from the spy.

#### Squads ####

You work together in squads with the common goal to defeat the Death Star. A squad can consist of any number of members and skill level. When someone in the squad completes a mission on behalf of the squad, the mission will be deemed completed for the entire squad. This means that if another squad member completes the same mission, it will not give points. 

## Scoring ##

The points are obtained as your squad completes the missions. The sooner your team completes a mission, the more points you will get. But don't worry, also the last squad to complete a mission will give valuable damage to the Death Star.
