## Introduction ##

The Death Star needs to be defeated. You and your Jedi Starfighters are the last hope of the Rebels! 

The adventure is intense and a set of missions (See missions map here) must be accomplished in order to achieve the desired victory!

In the first mission, you'll need to DEPLOY your first fighter and prepare it for the battle ! Get more details here

One fighter is not enough and you certainly will need another one to help you defeating DeathStars defenses. SCALE up and add a fighter to your squad. Get more details here

Now that your squad has 2 fighters, you will be able to attack DeathStar SHIELD and destroy it! Get more details here 

The final 2 missions require a bit more effort:

In one of them you will have to get DeathStar core coordinates and DATABASE credentials, unfolding its endpoint and attack it!!!

In the other one ITERATE defenses of DeathStar are randomly created and the fatal shot you'll need to fire will be harder to take!
