3. Deploy a new version of your microservice either by using [Continous Integration and Deployment](../deployment/cicd.md) or the [manual](../deployment/manually.md) approach. 

4. When your updated microservice is live, it will hopefully hit the Death Star's Reactor Core!

5. If you feel that your microservice is not behaving correctly or might not have been deployed correctly, have a look at the logs as described [here](../logs.md). If you are using the Continuous Integration and Deployment strategy, explore the status of your build in Developer Cloud as described [here](../devcs.md)

### Next: End ###
