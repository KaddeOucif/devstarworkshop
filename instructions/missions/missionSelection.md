## Mission Selection ##

When the shield has been damaged enough. Our spy should be able to retrieve some more information hidden within deeper systems inside the Death Star! When the spy has returned with the new information you will have to make a decision on which mission you want to do next. Monitor the SPY component in the Dashboard.

The missions can be done in any order you prefer or, if you have multiple microservices in your squad, you could try to complete the missions in parallel!
