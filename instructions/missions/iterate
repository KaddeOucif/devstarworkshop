## Mission 5. Iterate the base URL! ##

### Mission Description ###

Write here....


### Mission Awards ###

1. The first squad to hit the database will be awarded **500** points
2. The second squad to hit the database will be awarded **400** points
3. Subsequent squads will be awarded **300** points

### Mission Instructions ###

Explain the need to use a loop (for, while, etc)....

2. We now need to fire at the coordinates of the database! Use your selected weapon to implement a function that fires against the shield. This time to get the base URL you first need to access the database and retrieve it from it with a SQL SELECT command! As you get the base URL you can then fire it up as you did in the previous Shield mission: 

```https://ds-backend-gse00010206.apaas.em2.oraclecloud.com/shield/{Coordinates_goes_here}/{Your_squad_name_goes_here}/{Your_microservice_name_goes_here}```. The shield will get hit by either GET or POST bullets!
Example: GET ```https://ds-backend-gse00010206.apaas.em2.oraclecloud.com/shield/943x2323/Red Squad/javaxwingclient```

3. Deploy a new version of your microservice either by using [Continous Integration and Deployment](deployment/cicd.md) or the [manual](deployment/manually.md) approach. 

4. When your updated microservice is live, you could use it to hit the Death Star's shield!
